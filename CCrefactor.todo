CC refactor plans

☐ create common CC code skeleton which most of CCs will use
☐ review all current validation and put some global validation for all CCs
☐ figure out best way to use tokens in other CCs
☐ find a proper way to trigger validation for CC transactions that don't spend CC inputs (two step tx with marker)
☐ investigate is there a benefit to load CC modules dynamically and implement it if so
☐ go through all CC RPC and make neccessary data validations
☐ use CCError in all CC RPCs or find better solution if neccessary
☐ 1:1 sidechains for gateways
